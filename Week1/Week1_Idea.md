## 1. Payday Lending and Regional Fiscal Stimulus: Local Multiplier Effects in High-Risk Credit Markets 

- **Motivation:** It is well established that there is significant
  heterogeneity in consumption responses to fiscal stimulus payments.
  For example, @bakeretall find that the effects of stimulus are much
  greater when targeted at households with a low level of liquidity.
  Individuals with less than \$100 in their accounts spend over 40
  percent of stimulus within first month. Moreover, using a large-scale
  survey of US consumers, @Coinbon study how transfers from CARES act
  affect individuals' consumption, savings, and labor supply decisions.
  They find that relative to white households, black households save
  less and pay off more debt, on average. Liquidity constrained
  individuals use less of stimulus to save and pay more debt relative to
  unconstrained households. They also have higher MPCs than
  non-liquidity constrained households. To better understand the
  heterogeneity in MPCs arising from liquidity constraints combined with
  my interests in payday loans, I am motivated to investigate how high
  reliance on payday lending may influence regional responses to fiscal
  expansions due to immediate liquidity needs. Particularly, do regions
  with high reliance on payday lending and other subprime credit markets
  respond differently to fiscal expansions? (Potentially due to
  immediate liquidity needs and credit constraints.)

- **Research Question:** Does the presence of payday lending in a region
  affect the local fiscal multiplier? Are local multipliers larger or
  smaller in communities with high subprime credit dependence? Does
  access to payday loans amplify or suppress consumption responses to
  fiscal transfers? How can we aggregate these regional findings to
  national estimates?

- **Empirical Strategy:** Map payday lending locations and measure the
  density of payday loan shops per capita. Match these geographic
  measures with ARRA spending data or COVID relief disbursements at the
  county level. Use instrumental variables (IV) based on historical
  credit access and state-level payday lending regulations to identify
  exogenous variation in payday lending exposure. Or use physical
  distance to payday loan bank as exogenous variation? Estimate local
  multipliers using regional consumption and income responses.

- **Connection to Literature:** Extends @nakamura2011fiscal on regional
  multipliers by introducing local credit constraints and integrates
  @pinardon2023crowding concept of financial crowding out, but applied
  to subprime credit markets.

## 2. Financial Inclusion and the Transmission of Fiscal Multipliers 

- **Motivation:** According to data from the Survey of Consumer Finance
  (SCF), there are notable gaps in access to financial markets espically
  among low-income, Black and Hispanic adults. Six percent of all adults
  were unbanked in 2023 but among low-income adults, it is twenty-three
  percent. Regions with higher unbanked populations or reliance on
  alternative financial services (e.g., check cashing, title loans) may
  experience different consumption responses to fiscal injections due to
  limited banking infrastructure.

- **Research Question:** Does the degree of financial inclusion in a
  region influence the effectiveness of fiscal stimulus on local
  consumption? Are regions with high rates of unbanked households less
  responsive to fiscal stimulus? Does direct deposit versus check
  disbursement affect the velocity of money in low-credit regions?

- **Empirical Strategy:** Map financial inclusion metrics (e.g., FDIC
  surveys, CFPB data, or SCF data) to regional ARRA spending and
  stimulus payments. Maybe analyze regions with state policies on check
  cashing limits or direct deposit mandates or try to measure
  consumption spillovers in regions with different banking access
  levels.

- **Connection to Literature:** Builds on @woodford2011simple and
  @pinardon2023crowding by testing how financial frictions affect fiscal
  transmission and crowding out from limited financial infastructure.
