Hi Zorah,

Feedback below. Please send me an email when you have had the time to read it, think about it, incorporate the easy parts, and run some preliminary tests so we can chat.

Best,

Juan

## Feedback.

### General impression.

I was very satisfied with the level of work, precision in your language, and care of thought that you put into this. You should feel very pleased about your effort.

### Specific Threshold

I had the impression that you don't have to constraint yourself to the threshold of 4\% that Oliver documents using aggregate data, there are some useful tests to discover regime changes/structural breaks/... Please ask DK about the Hansen test he uses in his paper.

### More literature 

You should check this paper https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304393224000217

My coauthor Mathieu tells me they looked at how local inflation shapes inflation expectations after including time fixed effects in a panel. Different to your idea of state dependence, but something to be aware of.

Why don't you look at Mathieu's papers to explore this idea further. I can definitely connect you with him if you find a use to the data that he has used and either he can tell you if getting access is feasible or if you can colaborate in some form.

### Concerns

My main concern is that the data you are looking at is regionally too aggregated for you to find sufficient variation. There are a couple of alternatives.

Another alternative is that you use moments measured by other people (for example in this paper https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/-/media/faculty/michael-weber/tell-me-something.pdf) and a model to inform about differential attention.

### Next steps

Obviously, you should test your idea with the data you have now, but I would not discard the idea if you don't find anything, I would take it as an indication that you need better data.
